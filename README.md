# PASSWORD-BASED-DOOR-OPEN-SYSTEM-USING-LPC2148
This repository contains the source code for a Password-Based Door Open System implemented on LPC2148 microcontroller. The system utilizes a keypad to input a password and controls a DC motor to simulate the opening and closing of a door. Additionally, a simulated output using Proteus is provided in the video "Case Study and Report.mp4," and a detailed project report can be found in "project report.pdf."

## Contents:
**code.txt:**
This file contains the complete source code written in C for the LPC2148 microcontroller. The code includes functions for keypad input, LCD display, DC motor control, and overall system functionality.

**project report.pdf:** 
A comprehensive project report is available in PDF format. It covers the project's introduction, objectives, methodology, hardware details, software implementation, results, and conclusions.

**Case Study and Report.mp4:**
This video file demonstrates the simulated output of the project using Proteus. It provides a visual representation of the Password-Based Door Open System in action.

## Usage:
To use the source code, follow these steps:
```
Open the LPC2148 microcontroller project in your preferred development environment.
Upload the code to the microcontroller.
Connect the necessary hardware components, including the keypad, DC motor, and any required peripherals.
Power on the system and interact with the keypad to test the password-based door open functionality.
```
## Note:
The hardware implementation video is not available in this repository.
If you have a video documenting the real-time implementation, consider adding it to enhance the project's documentation.

Ensure that you have the LPC2148 development environment set up before attempting to run the code.
